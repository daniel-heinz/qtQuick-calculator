# qtQuick-Calculator

A very simple calculator written in python and based on the Qt5 GUI framework (pyQt).

This repository is there to demonstrate how easy to use the QML (or also known as Qt-'Quick') subset of
the Qt framework is in conjunction with Python.
The UI was created / defined in QML (QtQuick 2.5 and other bundled QML extensions), this was done with the
support of the Qt Creator tool, and is then loaded in python by the pyQt5 framework.
